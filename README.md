Simple Quadratic/Cubic curve implementations in Unity.

The curves have their own data structure, allowing you to create at start, sample whenever you want and update point locations and point count.

Quadratic Curve data structure;
Cubic Curve data structure.

Curves classes contain:

	Evaluate(float t)
	Draw()
	Update(p1, p2, pivot, [pivot2])
	UpdatePointCount(int count)
	Next()

Feel free to make pull requests and add more spline types!
